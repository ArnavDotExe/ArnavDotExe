I work at the overlap of AI, embedded systems, and computer vision. Sometimes the projects are useful, sometimes they’re just experiments to see what’s possible.  

## What I Work On  
- AI/ML models for anomaly detection, classification, and decision-making  
- Computer vision in real-time environments   
- IoT setups with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, NodeMCU  
- Networking and privacy experiments 
- Side projects ranging from retro gaming builds to robotics with custom motor control  

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python, C, Embedded C, Java  
- **AI/ML:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, YOLOv5, EfficientNet, scikit-learn  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, image/video processing pipelines  
- **Web & Apps:** Streamlit, Flask, basic frontend for dashboards and interfaces  
- **IoT / Embedded:** Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, NodeMCU, N20 motor control  
- **Networking / Systems:** VPN configs, Pi-hole, Linux environments  
- **Tools:** Git, Docker (for deployment), Jupyter, AWS (basic deployment)  

## Education  
- B.E. in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning – SIES Graduate School of Technology (Class of 2026)
